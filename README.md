Data Description :
The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.



Algorithms used :
In this dataset i've used five clustering algorithm to perform segmentation.These algorithms are given below.

K-Means Clustering

Agglomerative Clustering

Spectral Clustering

DBSCAN Clustering

GaussianMixture Model based clustering

Final Model :
We have created a Streamlit Application based on this clustering technique, where we are taking the customer details & identifying which cluster the custoemr belongs to.
